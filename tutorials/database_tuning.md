##  General tips
 UnityBase designed to support different types of databases (Oracle, MS SQL, Postgre, ......).
 Even if you develop your application for some specific database, there is a chance that later
 you will need to migrate it to other database (for example from Oracle to Postgres).
 So, general tip:
 
 > Do not use database-specific features in your application
 
 DataStore - a server-side class for database access is highly optimized for speed.
 Usually it is faster to execute several simple queries from application server and
 do something inside JavaScript instead of write complex database query.
 
 In any cases developer must remember - usually there is __only ONE database__  server for application,
 but we can run multiple application servers and do load balancing.
 So in most cases performance bottleneck is a Database. 
 
 > Use the database for those things for which it was designed. Be [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) -
 database for storing data, application server for data manipulation
 
## Indexes
By default UnityBase DDL generator create indexes for all attributes of type `Entity`
and unique indexes for attributes marked as `"isUnique": true`. 

In case additional indexes are required developer can specify it inside entity metadata `dbKeys` for **UNIQUE** indexes 
or inside `dbExtensions` for any other index type (including functional indexes for Oracle/Postgres)

### Optimizing `like` queries
Special index type **CATALOGUE** is available for optimizing queries with substring search: `where field like "%substr%"`.

Such queries usually produced by UI Select/ComboBox controls while user typing a text to search or from Filters in Grid 
when `Contains` condition is selected. Database always do a table full scan for such a queries, what may lead to performance
problems when the table is large (100 000 records or more).  

To avoid a full scan developer can define a "CATALOGUE" dbExtension as such:

```myEntity.meta
  "dbExtensions": {
    "CIDX_TMD_CAPTION": {
      "type": "CATALOGUE",
      "definition": {
        "keys": {
          "caption": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
where `CIDX_TMD_CAPTION` is a index name and `caption` is attribute on which substring queries are executed.

Depending on database type UBQL query
```
UB.Repository('myEntyity').attrs('ID' 'caption').where('caption', 'like', 'substr').selectAsObject()
```
will be translated to SQL

 - Oracle
 DDL generator creates CTXSYS.ctxcat index and DML generator creates CATSEARCH where expression  
```
  // ? = 'substr*'
  select ID, caption from myEntity where CATSEARCH(caption, ?, null) > 0 
```

 - PostgresSQL
 DDL generator creates [trigram](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html) index what work with ILIKE, so 
 statement will be:
```
 // ? = '%substr%'
  select ID, caption from myEntity where caption ILIKE ? 
``` 

####  CATALOGUE pre-requirements for Oracle
- Check Database Collation

Since `CTXCAT` indexes is not allowed for NVARCHAR2 columns DDL will convert such columns to VARCHAR2.
To store international characters correctly in varchar3 columns ensure Oracle database is created using UTF8 collation
```
SELECT PARAMETER, VALUE FROM nls_database_parameters WHERE PARAMETER = 'NLS_CHARACTERSET' 
```        
NLS_CHARACTERSET value should be *UTF[8|16]
```
NLS_CHARACTERSET     AL32UTF8
NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET    AL16UTF16
```
 
- Enable Oracle Text

Oracle text should be enabled for Oracle instance
Can be checked by statement (under sys)
```sql
SELECT comp_id, comp_name, status FROM dba_registry where COMP_NAME='Oracle Text'
```

See [Oracle Text Setup instruction](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/install.112/e27508/initmedia.htm#DFSIG269)    

- Grant Permissions

To create a `CTXCAT` index CTXAPP and CTX_DDL should be granted to role 
```
GRANT RESOURCE, CONNECT, CTXAPP TO UBDF_FSS_TST;
GRANT EXECUTE ON CTXSYS.CTX_DDL TO UBDF_FSS_TST; 
```

## Array binding
UnityBase can bind arrays (array of int64 or array of strings are supported) as parameters value:

```
UB.Repository('uba_user').attrs('ID').where('[ID]', 'in', [1, 2, 3]).select()
```

Depends on a RDBMS a resulting query became:

### Oracle array binding
UB server generates a query
```
SELECT A01.ID  FROM uba_user A01  WHERE A01.ID IN (SELECT column_value FROM table(CAST( :1 AS SYS.ODCINUMBERLIST)))
```

crates in-memory SYS.ODCINUMBERLIST / SYS.ODCIVARCHAR2LIST structure and pass it as a parameter value to bind.

We don't know how to run such query with parameters binding in plsql, without parameters:
```
SELECT A01.ID  FROM uba_user A01  WHERE A01.ID IN (SELECT column_value FROM table(SYS.ODCINUMBERLIST(1, 2, 3)))
```   

### SQL Server array binding
UB server generates a query
```
SELECT A01.ID  FROM uba_user A01  WHERE A01.ID IN (SELECT * FROM ?)
```
creates in-memory IDList / StrList structure, fills it with passed array elements and binds to parameter value

To run such query in management studio:
```
declare @a dbo.IDList;
insert into @a (id) values (1), (2), (3);
SELECT A01.ID  FROM uba_user A01  WHERE A01.ID IN (SELECT * FROM @a)
```

### Postgres SQL array binding   
UB server generates a query
```
SELECT A01.ID  FROM uba_user A01  WHERE A01.ID=ANY($1)
```
transform passed array into Postgres array syntax string `{1,2,3}` and bind such string as parameter value

To execute a query in DBeaver tool press Ctrl+Enter, in binding dialog type "'{1,2,3}'" (in single quote)

## Oracle connection in depth

UnityBase works with Oracle using direct call to OCI (Oracle Call Interface library).
This allows to use all Oracle-specific features, minimize function calls and memory allocation and therefore work on maximum speed.

While creating a connection to the Oracle server UnityBase sets some specific connection properties.
This properties may not be like those, which set TOAD, PL/SQL Developer, DBeaver or other tools.
Therefore some queries work in different way inside UnityBase server and TOAD (for example).
But don't be confused - below we explain how to make them work in the same way:

### Session variables 
Set the same session parameters as UnityBase sets.

Look at server log - before the first database statement execution you can see instruction like `ALTER SESSION SET NLS........`;
This instruction set Locale Settings. You can change it in advanced connection configuration for your application.

Find all such instruction and execute it inside tool you use for work with database. Usually this is:
```
ALTER SESSION SET NLS_DATE_FORMAT='YYYY-MM-DD-HH24:MI:SS';
ALTER SESSION SET NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS = ". ";
ALTER SESSION SET NLS_COMP=LINGUISTIC;
ALTER SESSION SET NLS_SORT=BINARY_CI;
```

### Parameters in queries
UnityBase always try to parametrise queries. For example in case you execute query
```
store.runSQL('select * from somethere where code like :myCode:', {myCode: 'value%'});
```
end expect to see the same execution plane in your tool, parametrise it!
For example in DBeaver: 
```
// WRONG - the query plan may be different from what will be for the application server 
select * from somethere where code like 'value%'
// GOOD
select * from somethere where code like :myCode
```

When DBeaver asks for parameters value - type value% and set parameter type to nvarchar2

 > Always set parameter type for string parameters to NVARCHAR2. This is the way UnityBase pass string parameters to Oracle
 
#### Parameter types
When binding parameters for query UB applies this convention to call [OCIBundByPos](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/appdev.920/a96584/oci15r30.htm)

| JS Type | Oracle Type |
|---------|-------------|
| Int32   | SQLT_INT    |
| int64, float, double | SQLT_FLT |
| Date    | SQLT_DAT |
| String  | SQLT_STR (NVARCHAR2) |
| Blob    | SQLT_LVB |

For parameters of type `string` in case database table column is not of the type NVARCHAR2 to use a database index
you can cast parameter directly to type you need

```
  ...  where my_function(column) = cast(my_function(?) as varchar2(xxx))
```  

The same POSSIBLE but not mandatory  for Int64/Float type of parameter.
