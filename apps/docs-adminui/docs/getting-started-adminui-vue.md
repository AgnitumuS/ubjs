This documentation describes visual components bundled into `@unitybase/adminui-vue` package.
All components are already registered using `Vue.component`, so can be used without any additional steps.

All components are separated into 3 main group:
  - presentational components: can be used without UnityBase server
  - data-aware components: use knowledge about UnityBase metadata to configure itself depending on Domain
  - views: `smart components` such as forms etc. (todo)
