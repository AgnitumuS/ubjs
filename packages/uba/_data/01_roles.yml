# ELS for build-in roles
# roles itself are created during `ubcli initDB` command
# most ELS rules are defined as `custom` due to historical reasons (to keep the same rule code as before ub-migrate)
#  in new files prefer to use one of `read`, `write, etc. rules instead of custom - see https://git-pub.intecracy.com/unitybase/ub-migrate#system-roles
